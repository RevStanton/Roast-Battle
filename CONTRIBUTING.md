# Contributing to AI Roast Battle Arena

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is all about making people laugh, so let's keep it fun and collaborative.

## How to Contribute

### Adding New Personas

1. Edit the `personas` array in `index.html`
2. Follow this structure:
```javascript
{
    id: 'unique-id-here',
    emoji: '🎭', // Pick a fun emoji
    name: 'Persona Name',
    description: 'Short, punchy description for the UI',
    style: 'Detailed personality traits, speaking style, and quirks for the AI to embody'
}
```

3. Make sure your persona:
   - Has a distinct personality
   - Isn't based on a real person (fictional archetypes only!)
   - Would be funny in a roast battle
   - Has a clear speaking style

### Improving the UI

- Keep the bold, energetic design aesthetic
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, keyboard navigation)
- Add comments for complex CSS

### Bug Fixes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix-something`
3. Make your changes

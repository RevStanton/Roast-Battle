## 🚀 Quick Start

### Recommended: Deploy to Vercel (Easiest & Best)

**See [VERCEL_DEPLOY.md](VERCEL_DEPLOY.md) for complete step-by-step instructions!**

Quick version:
1. Get an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Push this repo to GitHub
3. Import to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
4. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in Vercel
5. Done! Your app is live 🎉

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Select "Deploy from main branch"
4. Your app will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/roast-battle-arena`

**Note**: GitHub Pages only hosts the frontend. The AI roasts won't work without the backend API. Use Vercel for full functionality.

### Option 3: Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roast-battle-arena.git
cd roast-battle-arena
```

2. Create `.env` file with your API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Install Vercel CLI and run locally:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 How It Works

The app uses the Anthropic Claude API to generate roasts in real-time. Each persona has:
- A unique personality and speaking style
- Context awareness (responds to previous roasts)
- Topic-specific roasting ability

**Architecture**:
- **Frontend**: Single HTML page with vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless function (`api/generate-roast.js`)
- **API**: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 for roast generation

Your API key is stored securely in Vercel environment variables and never exposed to the browser.

## 🎨 Customization

### Add Your Own Personas

Edit the `personas` array in `index.html`:

```javascript
{
    id: 'your-persona-id',
    emoji: '🎯',
    name: 'Your Persona Name',
    description: 'Short description',
    style: 'Detailed personality and speaking style for AI'
}
```

### Modify the Design

All styles are in the `<style>` section. Change colors using CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    --flame-orange: #FF6B35;
    --electric-blue: #004E89;
    --danger-red: #FF0054;
    --neon-yellow: #FFE74C;
}
```

### Adjust Battle Rounds

In the `runBattle` function, change:

```javascript
const rounds = 3; // Change to any number
```
